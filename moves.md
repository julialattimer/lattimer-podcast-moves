# Common Moves in Podcasting

I decided to focus on educational podcasts, namely, “Colors” from *Radiolab* and “Infomagical Bootcamp” from *Note to Self*. These podcasts overlap in various ways, but they are distinctly separate. One show focuses on the science of colors and the other on the science of, well, focusing. In order to effectively address these subjects, the podcasts must stick to some basic educational moves while also tailoring their shows to the content at hand

## Organization

*Radiolab*’s podcast, “Colors” details the many ways in which colors affect our world and the ways in which our world understands colors. This varies among species, since the human, butterfly, and almighty mantis shrimp have very different colored-vision systems. This also varies culturally, since many cultures don’t have corresponding words for every color, and cultures interpret colors differently. This show is very broad, giving as complete an understanding of color as possible.

*Note to Self*’s podcast, “Infomagical Bootcamp” details the hazardous effects of multitasking. First it outlines just how severe of a problem multitasking is, and then it explains what multitasking does to our brain, our social lives, our happiness and our stress levels. Throughout this podcast, they frequently refer back to a “Five-Day Challenge,” in which the listener is compelled to try “single-tasking” for five days. Getting the reader to attempt the Five-Day Challenge is the objective of this podcast, so it is organized in a manner similar to a sales-pitch, with a final reminder to “Do the full Five-Day Challenge!” at the end of the show.

### Sound Effects

“Colors” is chalk-full of goofy sound effects. For example, when they’re explaining how different animals see colors differently, they’re challenged with using no visuals whatsoever. So, they use a choir. Every time the spectrum of colors grows, say between a dog and a crow, the choir adds in more harmonizing parts and gets slightly louder. This is an effective way of explaining the differences in color vision between species. They also have small boings, zaps, and dings to add to the common conversation that makes the podcast more interesting. It also often has people talking slightly over one another. The main podcaster fades other voices out and talks over them to summarize the conversation. This made it difficult to follow sometimes, especially with such a long and far-reaching podcast.

“Infomagical Bootcamp” made a much simpler stylistic decision. They mostly stuck to their own voices and background music. Not once did they bring in a goofy effect to enhance their show. I would say that this was an effective way to sell listeners information on staying focused. They maintained constant conversation while smooth, ambient music played in the background.

#### Narrative Types

“Colors” jumped around quite a lot in their narrative decisions. They constantly brought in new elements. Sometimes, they would reimagine historical events, like Isaac Newton’s discovery of the color prism. Other times, they would interview color experts. The trouble with “Colors” is that it was very broad and had no thesis. All of these elements, from “dogs are colorblind” to “blue is extremely rare in nature,” are not connecting to teach me anything specific about colors. Rather, they overload me with information only connected thematically to colors.

“Infomagical Bootcamp” stuck to interviews as their main narrative type. Each interviewee was an expert on the disastrous act of multitasking. Listeners understood from the beginning that multitasking must be corrected in order to live functional, fulfilled lives, especially because multitasking has gotten out of control since the social media boom. This is a sort of thesis that drove their podcast to the call-to-action: “Do the full Five-Day Challenge!” This was more effective than “Colors” in some ways, because it was concise.
